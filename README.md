master_subassemblies_creator.py should be compiled into an executable using the following:  
  
```pyinstaller -y -F -c master_subassemblies_creator.py```  
  
  
The directory that this program is run on should contain _only_ the subassembly PDFs and one (1) .xlsx file exported from ProjectWise.
- The naming for this file doesn't matter, however it should be prefixed by a "_".
